# Scheduler

Implements functions that effectively accomodate:
A First in, First out(FIFO) scheduling algorithm which prioritizes the oldest job in a system first and moves down the list
A Shortest Job First(SJF) algorithm which prioritizes the job that will take the least amount of time
A Round Robin(RR) algorithm which equally prioritizes all processes as it rotates through them all, adding processes as they get created and removing them as they get finished.
